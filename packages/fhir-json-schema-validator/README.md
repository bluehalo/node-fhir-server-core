# FHIR-JSON-SCHEMA-VALIDATOR

> Utility for validating FHIR resources

## Install

```shell
yarn add @bluehalo/fhir-json-schema-validator
```

## Arguments

`@bluehalo/fhir-json-schema-validator` exports a single class called JSONSchemaValidator. This class takes two optional
arguments for initialization:

> #### `schema`
>
> This is the path to the JSON schema that you would like to validate against. It defaults to the `fhir.schema.json` file
> included in this package.

#### `ajvSettings`

This is an object with the settings to pass on to AJV. It defaults to suppresses `log` and `warn` messages, but logs `error`
messages. For a full list of AJV options see the README on the AJV GitHub page athttps://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv.

```
// Default initialization:
let defaultValidator = new JSONSchemaValidator();

// Custom initialization
let defaultValidator = new JSONSchemaValidator(schema, ajvSettings);
```

## Usage

The QueryBuilder class has a method called `validate` which takes two arguments:

> #### `resource`
>
> The resource that is to be validated against the FHIR JSON schema.

> #### `verbose`
>
> Boolean value specifying whether or not to return the full set of validation errors (true) or to take the time to
> condense error messages (false). Defaults to false. The error messages generated by the over-arching json schema
> are too numerous to be of any use. For any specific resource, we can compile a resource-specific validator and
> re-validate to get more concise and helpful error messages.

The `validate` method returns an array that contains any errors generated from validation.
This list will be of length 0 if no errors were found.

See `index.test.js` for examples of usage
