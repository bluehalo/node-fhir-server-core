This module is meant to be imported and used by the fhir-qb. Included are implementations of the following methods:

```
	assembleSearchQuery,
	buildAndQuery,
	buildComparatorQuery,
	buildContainsQuery,
	buildEndsWithQuery,
	buildEqualToQuery,

These are used by the fhir-qb to build a query that will work in the sql aggregation pipeline.
